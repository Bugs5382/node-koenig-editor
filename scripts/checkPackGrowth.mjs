// Package growth gate: compare this build's tarball with the last published
// release. Run it after `npm run build`:
//
//   npm run build && npm run check:pack:growth
//
// It reads `npm pack --dry-run --json --ignore-scripts` for this build and
// `npm view <name> version dist.unpackedSize dist.fileCount --json` for the
// version on the `latest` dist-tag, and fails when the unpacked size or the
// file count grows past the allowed percentage. A package that has never been
// published has nothing to compare against, so the check passes and says so.
//
// The threshold is per repo: set `config.packMaxGrowthPercent` in package.json.
// Tiny packages swing by large percentages on small edits, so growth under
// MIN_GROWTH_BYTES bytes or MIN_GROWTH_FILES files never fails on its own.
//
// Intended growth: add the `pack-size-approved` label to the PR. The workflow
// passes it in as PACK_GROWTH_APPROVED=true, and the check still reports the
// growth but does not fail. Say why the package grew in the PR body.
